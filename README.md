# Keep a Changelog Action Toolkit

A toolkit library containing common helper code that is shared across @release-flow GitHub Actions. The tools are mainly
[remark](https://remark.js.org/) plugins that parse and manipulate the markdown content within the changelog.

The toolkit is really intended for use only with the @release-flow GitHub Actions, so it's not heavily documented.
